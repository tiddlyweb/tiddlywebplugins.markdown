# Intro

A [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com/) plugin to render markdown
syntax wikitext to HTML using the
[Python Markdown](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown) library.

The source repository is available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/tiddlyweb/tiddlywebplugins.markdown).

# Features

If `markdown.wiki_link_base` is set in
[instance](http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/instance) config, then
TiddlyWeb oriented features are turned on (see below),
otherwise the text is treated as straight Markdown.

Additional Markdown extensions can be activated via the `markdown.extensions`
configuration settings, which is a tuple of two items: A list of extension names
and a dictionary with configuration settings.

By default some extensions are included:

* `fenced_code`: http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/fenced_code_blocks.html
* `def_list`: http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/definition_lists.html
* `foootnotes`: http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/footnotes.html
* `headerid`: http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/header_id.html

The TiddlyWeb features add the following:

* `wikilinks`: CamelCase
* `freelinks`: [[some page]]
* `labeled freelinks`: [[label|some page]]
* `transclusion`: see below

Wikilinks and freelinks will be prefixed by `wiki_link_base`.
Set it to '' (emptry string) to activate the features without any prefix.

Transclusion uses the following syntax:

```
{{tiddler title}}
```

That will include tiddler with the given title from the
current context (recipe or bag) of the transcluding tiddler.

Links and transclusion can be augmented with `@target` syntax:

* `@target`
* `CamelCase@target`
* `[[some page]]@target`
* `[[label|some page]]@target`
* `{{tiddler title}}@target`

`target` is resolved via three different configuration settings:

* `markdown.interlinker` names a function which returns a link
   to whatever might be considered a target of some kind. It's
   arguments are a WSGI environ and a string representing the
   target. It returns a URI for the target, without the title
   of the tiddler.

* `markdown.target_resolver` names a function which determinesh
   the tiddler object that is to be transcluded. It's arguments
   are a WSGI environ, a string representing the context from
   which a tiddler is being transcluded and a tiddler object.
   That tiddler object is modified in place to add the bag in
   which it can be found.

* `markdown.transclude_url` names a function which returns a
   link to a tiddler in a target context. It's arguments are a
   WSGI environ and a tiddler. It returns a URI for the tiddler
   that has been transcluded. This is useful for augmenting the
   output to include a link to the transcluded tiddler.

To use this renderer on Tiddlers which have a type of
`text/x-markdown` adjust
[tiddlywebconfig.py](http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/tiddlywebconfig.py)
to include:

```
'wikitext.type_render_map' :{
    'text/x-markdown': 'tiddlywebplugins.markdown'
}
```

If you want all tiddlers with no type to be rendered as markdown,
then set

```
'wikitext.default_renderer': 'tiddlywebplugins.markdown'
```
